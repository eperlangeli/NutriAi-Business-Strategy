NutriAI: AI-Driven Preventive Health Platform
Concept: Transforming lifestyle data into predictive health risk models for the Insurance & Fintech industry.# NutriAi-Business-Strategy
Executive Summary:
NutriAI is a HealthTech platform that bridges the gap between wearable data (Apple Health, Apple Watch) and dynamic insurance pricing. By leveraging longitudinal data on nutrition and physiology, we enable a shift from static pricing to behavioral-based risk modeling.

The Problem & Solution:
 The Gap: Insurance companies rely on episodic, historical data with limited predictive power.  

 The Solution: Continuous, longitudinal data collection (Heart Rate, BMI, Sleep, Nutrition) to create a Behavioral Health Score.  
Business Model (The "InsurTech" Angle):
 B2C: Subscription-based dynamic nutrition plans.  
 B2B (Primary Scalability): Enterprise licensing for Insurance providers. Moving from Static Pricing to Predictive Pricing.  

Tech Stack & Compliance:
 Core: AI-driven adaptive algorithms for nutritional scaling.  
 Integrations: Apple HealthKit API / Wearable sync.  

 Governance: GDPR compliant, explicit consent tracking, and unique ID pseudonymization
